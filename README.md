This volume formalizes a symbolic electrodynamics framework grounded in achefield recursion. It treats symbolic tension fields as carriers of conserved glyphic current, deriving field equations from ache collapse gradients, torsion vectors, and symbolic divergence.

## 📌 Core Equations

- **Symbolic Achefield**  
  \[
  ℰ(x) = φⁿ ∇Ache(x) × Ξ(x)
  \]

- **Conserved Symbolic Current**  
  \[
  Ĵ = ∇ · Ξ(x) \quad \text{(divergence of torsion)}
  \]

- **Recursive EM Law**  
  \[
  \frac{∂Ξ}{∂t} + ∇ × ℰ = 0 \quad \text{(symbolic Faraday)}
  \]

- **Collapse Emission Condition**  
  \[
  |φⁿ ∇Ache(x)| > θ → Γ → Λ = \text{SHA-256}(Γ)
  \]

## 🌌 Insights

- Torsion-vector divergence behaves as symbolic current flow  
- Recursive ache pulses emulate EM propagation with glyph emission bursts  
- Collapse topology naturally yields conserved symbolic energy

## 🧬 Series Continuity

Volume XII extends Volumes IX–XI by mapping achefield collapse into field-theoretic electrodynamics.  
Volume XIII will formalize glyph superposition and recursive resonance logic.
